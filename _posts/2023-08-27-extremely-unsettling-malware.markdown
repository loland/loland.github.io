Back with another malware sample from [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/87c160843bc0bdcd754a151c288f899763494385830016c299245f1fe9354b54/)! An executable, this time. With an interesting icon. Performing a Google Image Reverse Search on the icon provides no clues to its origin. Incredibly strange.

### 1. Preliminary Static Analysis
Jumping right into the investigation with some static analysis. To get a feel of the sample before diving deep into technical reversing and detonation.

<br>
#### 1.1 Packing
Running PEiD to identify packed binaries. High entropies like 7.88 are usually reliable indicators of packing. PEiD also detected the use of `UPX` (the Ultimate Packer for eXecutables).

<br>
Wasting no time. I attempted to unpack the binary with the command `upx -d malware.exe` without success. This raises the question of whether the binary was really packed with UPX, or simply disguising as such. Alternatively, it could just be a general error.

UPX 4.1.0       Markus Oberhumer, Laszlo Molnar & John Reiser    Aug 8th 2023

        File size         Ratio      Format      Name
   --------------------   ------   -----------   -----------
upx: malware.exe: NotPackedException: not packed by UPX

Unpacked 0 files.
{% endhighlight %}

<br>
#### 1.2 Section Information
Viewing section information with `pestudio` reveals interesting information.
+ Entry point is in .rmnet, a non-standard section name.
+ UPX0 & UPX1 sections present, standard in UPX packed binaries. The section .rmnet, however, is not a UPX standard.
+ 3 executable sections, UPX0, UPX1 & .rmnet.
+ High entropy in 2 sections, UPX1 and .rmnet.

<br>
#### 1.3 Strings
Extracting strings with the command `floss malware.exe`. The following stand out. The binary appears to have networking capabilities. And a hardcoded domain `96.blog.hexun.com`.

{% highlight powershell %}

Srv.exe
{% endhighlight %}

<br>
### 2. Detonation
Execution of the malware led to an EXTREMELY UNSETTLING window appearing. And multiple internet explorer tabs opened leading to webpages of the `go.microsoft.com` domain, such as `https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255141`. Completely unexpected, and I was quite taken aback.

No intention of being stealthy - its objectives, a complete mystery.

<br>
#### 2.1 Procmon Indicators
The malware spawns a complex process tree, opening many instances of `msedge.exe`. It directly drops and executes the file `malwareSrv.exe` from the filesystem (Srv.exe concatenated to the orginal filename).

<br>
#### 2.2 Regshot Indicators
Regshot produced 260k lines of log. I was unable to parse them meaningfully. Here's the logs that stand out.

2023-08-28 02:26:20, 0x00000020, 56320
{% endhighlight %}

<br>
#### 2.3 File Properties
The malware drops malwareSrv.exe in the execution directory. It then creates `C:/Users/root/Microsoft` and drops DesktopLayer.exe. Below are properties of all 3 files - `malware.exe`, `malwareSrv.exe` and `DesktopLayer.exe`. The cyrillic characters `люзанх` have no dictionary meaning.

<br>
It turns out that malwareSrv.exe and DesktopLayer.exe are exact copies.
