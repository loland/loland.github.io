Malware sample of unknown category from [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/5b30c309cd996a6ab8c1e2aad4e0d47a566f1cb8859677ac90f1253336451dd1). Just looking to perform a quick analysis and share any interesting findings.

<br>
### 1. Preliminary Analysis
The malware comes wrapped with a strange icon: A reverse image search finds its origin from Super Mario Bros assets.

<br>
Pretty standard sections and permissions. Nothing unusual here.

The sample does, however, import many suspicious libraries - some of their uses I can only make preliminary assumptions.

<b>Anti-Debugging</b>
    + EnumDisplayMonitors
    + GetMonitorInfo
    + EnumResourceLanguages
    + EnumDisplayDevices
    + HeapQueryInformation

<b>Shellcode/Unpacking</b>
    + VirtualProtect
    + VirtualAlloc

<b>Networking</b>
    + WSASocket
    + WSAloctl
    + WSASend
    + WSARecv

<br>
Running `floss malware.exe` produced lots of garbage strings, indicating that the binary could be packed. Besides that, nothing of interest in the floss output.
